## Formula

```
Gross Revenue    = Product Price + Shipping Charged
Transaction Fee  = Gross Revenue × 6.5%
Payment Fee      = Gross Revenue × 3% + $0.25
Total Etsy Fees  = Listing Fee + Transaction Fee + Payment Fee
Net Profit       = Gross Revenue − Product Cost − Shipping Cost − Total Fees
Profit Margin    = (Net Profit ÷ Gross Revenue) × 100
```
